# Atomic Habits Chatbot ðŸ“š

This project is a chatbot application where users can ask questions about the book *Atomic Habits* and receive insights and advice. The chatbot has read the entire *Atomic Habits* book, so you don't need to read the book yourself to get valuable information. You can simply ask any question related to the book and get instant answers!

For example, you can ask:
- "What are the 4 laws of behavior change?"
- "How can I build better habits?"
- "Explain the concept of habit stacking."

The chatbot will provide detailed explanations based on the content of the book.
